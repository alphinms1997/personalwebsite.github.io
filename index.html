            <img src="photo.jpg" alt="Alphin Malekandathil Soby" class="profile-photo">
            <p>Hi there! My name is Alphin Malekandathil Soby, and I'm a Mechanical Engineering graduate passionate about Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and fluid dynamics in general. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2020 and then embarked on a journey of self-training in CFD, which has become my true passion.</p>
            <p>I have a strong command of programming languages such as Python and C++, which I utilize extensively for CFD simulations. Additionally, I'm well-versed in numerical methods using Python and MATLAB, allowing me to tackle complex fluid dynamics problems with efficiency and accuracy. I have practical experience with simulation software like ANSYS and OpenFOAM.</p>
            <p>Despite not yet having professional experience in the engineering field, I'm currently working in a nursing home, providing care for elderly individualsâ€”a role I find incredibly fulfilling and rewarding. Even if I were to secure a job in the engineering sector, I would continue to dedicate my time to caring for the elderly because of my genuine passion for this work.</p>
            <p>I am a unique blend of someone who loves both the complexities of engineering and the heartfelt interactions involved in caregiving. Whether it's solving intricate fluid dynamics problems or providing compassionate care to those in need, I approach each endeavor with dedication and enthusiasm.</p>
